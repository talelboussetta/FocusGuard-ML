# Evidence-Based Study Methods

## Active Recall

Active recall is the practice of retrieving information from memory without looking at notes. **It is significantly more effective than rereading or highlighting.**

**Why It Works:**
- Strengthens neural pathways each time you retrieve information
- Identifies gaps in knowledge immediately
- Mimics exam conditions (retrieving under pressure)
- Creates stronger, more durable memories

**Examples of Active Recall:**
- **Blank page technique** - Write everything you know about a topic without notes, then check
- **Flashcards** - Question on front, answer on back (digital: Anki, Quizlet; physical cards)
- **Practice questions** - Solve problems from memory before checking solutions
- **Self-quizzing** - Create questions while studying, answer later without notes
- **Explain aloud** - Verbally explain concepts as if teaching someone

**Best Used For:**
- Exam preparation (simulates test conditions)
- Memorization-heavy subjects (biology, vocabulary, history)
- Identifying weak areas in understanding
- Building confidence with material

**How to Practice:**
1. Study material thoroughly (initial encoding)
2. Close notes and attempt to retrieve key points
3. Check accuracy and identify gaps
4. Restudy weak areas
5. Repeat retrieval attempts over time (spaced repetition)

## Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition means reviewing material at increasing intervals over time. **This dramatically improves long-term retention compared to cramming.**

**The Forgetting Curve:**
Without review, we forget ~70% of new information within 24 hours. Spaced repetition fights this decay by reviewing just before you would forget.

**Typical Review Schedule:**
- **Day 1** - Initial learning
- **Day 3** - First review (while still partially remembered)
- **Day 7** - Second review (interval increases)
- **Day 21** - Third review (longer interval)
- **Day 60** - Fourth review (material now in long-term memory)

**Why Increasing Intervals Work:**
- Each successful retrieval strengthens memory
- Spacing allows consolidation between reviews
- Longer intervals provide "desirable difficulty"
- More efficient than constant repetition

**Tools for Spaced Repetition:**
- **Anki** - Algorithm calculates optimal review times, syncs across devices
- **Quizlet** - Simpler interface, good for beginners
- **RemNote** - Combines note-taking with built-in spaced repetition
- **Custom system** - Leitner box with physical flashcards

**Implementation Tips:**
- Start early in the semester (can't cram spaced repetition)
- Review daily for consistency (even 10 minutes helps)
- Focus on difficult cards more frequently
- Retire mastered cards after 6+ successful reviews

## Feynman Technique

A learning method where you explain a concept in simple language **as if teaching a complete beginner**. Named after physicist Richard Feynman.

**The Four Steps:**

1. **Choose a concept** - Pick a specific topic you want to understand
2. **Explain it simply** - Write or speak as if teaching a child (no jargon)
3. **Identify gaps** - Where do you struggle to explain? Where do you use complex terms?
4. **Refine explanation** - Study weak areas, simplify further, use analogies

**Why It Works:**
- Forces you to truly understand, not just memorize
- Reveals gaps in knowledge that rereading misses
- Simplification requires deep processing
- Teaching is one of the most effective learning techniques

**Best For:**
- Conceptual understanding (physics, economics, biology)
- Detecting weak points in your knowledge
- Preparing to explain in exams (essay questions)
- Building confidence with difficult material

**Example Application (Photosynthesis):**

1. **Initial attempt:** "Photosynthesis is when plants use light to make food..."
2. **Identify gap:** "Wait, how exactly does light convert to chemical energy?"
3. **Study gap:** Review chloroplasts, electron transport chain
4. **Refined explanation:** "Plants are like solar panels. They capture sunlight in chloroplasts, which are like tiny batteries. The light energy breaks apart water molecules, and the plant uses the pieces to build sugar molecules for energy..."

**Variations:**
- Explain to a study partner (get feedback)
- Record yourself explaining (review for clarity)
- Write a simplified blog post or summary
- Draw a diagram while explaining (visual + verbal)
