# Mental Models

## First Principles Thinking
Break problems down to fundamental truths.
Rebuild solutions from the ground up.

---

## Pareto Principle (80/20)
80% of results come from 20% of efforts.
Focus on high-impact tasks.


---
## Occam’s Razor
Simpler explanations are usually better.
Choose the simplest solution that works.
---
## Systems Thinking
Understand how parts interact within a whole.
Consider feedback loops and emergent behavior.
---
## Inversion
Solve problems by considering the opposite.
Ask: "What if I did the reverse?"
---
## Second-Order Thinking
Consider long-term consequences.
Think beyond immediate effects.
---
## Probabilistic Thinking
Make decisions based on likelihoods.
Weigh risks and rewards.
---
## Mental Model Integration
Combine multiple models for better decisions.
Use diverse perspectives to analyze problems.
---
## Feynman Technique
Teach concepts to others to deepen understanding.
Identify gaps in knowledge through explanation.
---
## Confirmation Bias Awareness
Actively seek disconfirming evidence.
Challenge assumptions and beliefs.
---
## Opportunity Cost
Evaluate what you give up when choosing one option over another.
Consider alternatives and their potential value.
---
## Feedback Loops
Use feedback to improve systems.
Identify reinforcing and balancing loops.
---
## Marginal Utility
Assess additional benefits from incremental changes.
Optimize resource allocation based on diminishing returns.
---
## Cognitive Bias Mitigation
Recognize common biases (e.g., anchoring, availability).
Implement strategies to reduce their impact on decisions.
---
## Mental Model Mapping
Visualize relationships between different models.
Identify overlaps and gaps in understanding.
---
## Decision Trees
Map out possible outcomes of decisions.
Analyze paths and consequences systematically.
---
## Scenario Planning
Explore multiple future scenarios.
Prepare strategies for different possibilities.
---
## Bayesian Thinking
Update beliefs based on new evidence.
Use prior knowledge to inform decisions.
---
## Game Theory
Analyze strategic interactions.
Consider incentives and potential moves of others.
---
## Cost-Benefit Analysis
Weigh pros and cons of decisions.
Quantify benefits against costs for informed choices.
---
## Root Cause Analysis
Identify underlying causes of problems.
Use techniques like the "5 Whys" to dig deeper.
---
## Mental Model Maintenance
Regularly review and update mental models.
Incorporate new information and experiences.
---
## Cross-Disciplinary Learning
Draw insights from various fields.
Integrate knowledge for holistic understanding.
---
## Reflective Thinking
Regularly reflect on decisions and outcomes.
Learn from successes and failures.
---
## Adaptive Thinking
Stay flexible in problem-solving.
Adjust approaches based on changing circumstances.
---
## Metacognition
Be aware of your own thinking processes.
Monitor and regulate cognitive strategies.
---
## Heuristic Development
Create simple rules of thumb for decision-making.
Refine heuristics based on experience and feedback.
---
## Mental Model Sharing
Discuss and exchange models with others.
Gain new perspectives and insights.
---
## Continuous Learning
Commit to lifelong learning.
Update mental models with new knowledge.
---
## Application of Mental Models
Use mental models in real-world situations.
Practice applying models to enhance decision-making and problem-solving.
