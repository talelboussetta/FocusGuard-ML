# Time Management Strategies

## Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused intervals with regular breaks to maintain peak concentration.

**Standard Pomodoro Cycle:**
- 25 minutes of focused work
- 5 minutes break
- After 4 cycles, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

**Best used for:**
- Tasks requiring sustained concentration
- Fighting procrastination on difficult work
- Building focus stamina
- Time-boxing to prevent perfectionism

**Tips:**
- During work intervals: No checking phone, email, or social media
- During breaks: Physical movement, hydration, avoid screens
- Adjust intervals to fit your energy levels (e.g., 50-10 for experienced users)
- Track completed Pomodoros to quantify daily productivity

## Eisenhower Matrix

Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, not just deadlines.

**Four Quadrants:**
1. **Urgent & Important** → Do immediately (crises, deadlines, emergencies)
2. **Important but Not Urgent** → Schedule dedicated time (planning, learning, relationships)
3. **Urgent but Not Important** → Delegate or minimize (interruptions, some emails)
4. **Neither Urgent nor Important** → Eliminate (time wasters, busywork)

**Application Strategy:**
- Spend most time in Quadrant 2 (Important/Not Urgent) to prevent crises
- Reduce Quadrant 3 by setting boundaries and automating
- Eliminate Quadrant 4 activities ruthlessly
- Use this weekly to review your time allocation

## Weekly Planning

Plan at the week level rather than day-by-day for better big-picture perspective.

**Weekly Planning Process:**
1. **Review last week** - What worked? What didn't? Lessons learned?
2. **Identify fixed commitments** - Classes, meetings, appointments
3. **Define 3-5 weekly goals** - Most important outcomes for the week
4. **Allocate deep work blocks** - Schedule hardest work during peak energy times
5. **Schedule breaks and buffer time** - Build in flexibility for unexpected tasks
6. **Daily micro-planning** - Quick 5-minute review each morning to adjust
7. **Friday review** - Reflect on progress and plan next week

**Key Benefits:**
- See the big picture beyond daily urgencies
- Flexibility to move tasks around within the week
- Reduced decision fatigue from constant re-planning
- Better time allocation based on energy patterns
- Align daily actions with longer-term goals
- Improved work-life balance through intentional scheduling

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Over-scheduling (leave 40% of time unscheduled)
- Ignoring energy levels (don't schedule hard work when you're exhausted)
- Neglecting buffer time for unexpected tasks
- Failing to review and adjust weekly plans
