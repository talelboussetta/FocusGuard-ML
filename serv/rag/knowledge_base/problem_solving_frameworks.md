# Problem Solving Frameworks

## General Problem Solving
1. Understand the problem
2. Define inputs and outputs
3. Identify constraints
4. Solve stepwise
5. Test edge cases

---

## Divide and Conquer
Break complex problems into smaller subproblems.
Solve each independently.
Steps:
1. Decompose problem
2. Solve subproblems
3. Combine solutions
Best for:
- Algorithms
- Coding challenges
---
## Trial and Error
Iteratively test solutions.
Steps:
1. Propose solution
2. Test and evaluate
3. Refine based on feedback
Best for:
- Experimental problems
---
## Working Backwards
Start from desired outcome.
Steps:
1. Define goal state
2. Identify preceding steps
3. Reverse engineer to current state
Best for:
- Puzzle solving
---
## Hypothesis Testing
Formulate hypotheses and test them.
Steps:
1. State hypothesis
2. Design experiments
3. Analyze results
Best for:
- Scientific problems
---
## Analogical Reasoning
Use similar known problems to inform solutions.
Steps:
1. Identify analogous problem
2. Map similarities
3. Adapt solution
Best for:
- Creative problem solving
---
## Root Cause Analysis
Identify underlying causes of problems.
Steps:
1. Gather data
2. Identify possible causes
3. Analyze to find root cause
Best for:
- Troubleshooting
---
## SWOT Analysis
Evaluate Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.
Steps:
1. List strengths
2. List weaknesses
3. Identify opportunities
4. Identify threats
Best for:
- Strategic decision making
---
## PDCA Cycle
Plan-Do-Check-Act for continuous improvement.
Steps:
1. Plan: Identify problem and plan solution
2. Do: Implement solution
3. Check: Evaluate results
4. Act: Standardize or adjust
Best for:
- Process improvement
---
## 5 Whys
Ask "Why?" five times to uncover root causes.
Steps:
1. State problem
2. Ask "Why?" and answer
3. Repeat until root cause identified
Best for:
- Simple root cause analysis
---
## Mind Mapping
Visualize problems and solutions with diagrams.
Steps:
1. Write main problem in center
2. Branch out with related ideas
