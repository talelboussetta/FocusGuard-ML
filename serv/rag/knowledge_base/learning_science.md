# Learning Science Principles

## Bloom's Taxonomy

Learning progresses through six hierarchical levels of cognitive complexity:

1. **Remember** - Recall facts, terms, basic concepts
2. **Understand** - Explain ideas, summarize, interpret
3. **Apply** - Use information in new situations, solve problems
4. **Analyze** - Break down information, identify patterns, relationships
5. **Evaluate** - Make judgments, critique arguments, justify decisions
6. **Create** - Produce new work, design solutions, synthesize ideas

**Why It Matters:**
Effective studying targets higher levels (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create), not just memorization (Remember). Exam questions often test application and analysis.

**Application Examples:**
- ❌ **Remember only:** "Define photosynthesis" → Memorize definition
- ✅ **Analyze/Apply:** "How would reduced sunlight affect plant growth?" → Apply understanding to new scenario

**Study Strategy:**
Progress through levels: Start with understanding terms → Practice applying concepts → Analyze problems → Create your own examples

## Desirable Difficulty

Learning improves when tasks are challenging but achievable. **Easy studying feels productive but leads to weak retention.**

**The Illusion of Fluency:**
- Rereading notes feels smooth and easy → Creates false confidence
- Testing yourself feels hard and frustrating → Actually builds stronger memory

**Evidence-Based Difficult Techniques:**
- **Retrieval practice** - Answer questions without notes, then check
- **Interleaving** - Mix different problem types instead of blocking by type
- **Generation** - Try to solve before seeing the solution
- **Spacing** - Study over multiple sessions, not one marathon

**Examples:**
- ❌ Easy: Reread highlighted textbook chapter
- ✅ Difficult: Close book, write everything you remember, identify gaps

**How Challenging is Too Much?**
- Sweet spot: 70-80% success rate
- Too easy (<90% correct): Not learning efficiently
- Too hard (<50% correct): Demoralizing, overwhelming

## Cognitive Load Theory

Working memory has limited capacity (~4 chunks of information). Good learning minimizes unnecessary complexity to focus mental resources on understanding.

**Three Types of Cognitive Load:**
1. **Intrinsic** - Inherent difficulty of the material (can't reduce, but can manage)
2. **Extraneous** - Unnecessary complexity from poor presentation (should minimize)
3. **Germane** - Effort devoted to learning and understanding (want to maximize)

**Best Practices to Manage Cognitive Load:**

**Reduce Extraneous Load:**
- Eliminate distractions (phone, notifications, background TV)
- Avoid multitasking - focus on one task at a time
- Use clear diagrams and visuals instead of dense text
- Organize notes with headings, bullet points, white space

**Manage Intrinsic Load:**
- Break complex problems into smaller steps
- Learn one concept at a time before combining
- Build foundational knowledge before advanced topics
- Use worked examples before practice problems

**Increase Germane Load:**
- Summarize in your own words after reading
- Teach concepts to others (forces deep processing)
- Create concept maps to visualize relationships
- Test yourself frequently (retrieval strengthens memory)
- Take breaks to allow consolidation (Pomodoro Technique)

**Example Application (Math Problem):**
1. Understand the concept in isolation (what is the derivative?)
2. See a worked example (step-by-step solution)
3. Try a similar problem with notes available
4. Practice without notes (retrieval practice)
5. Mix with other problem types (interleaving)

**Memory Consolidation:**
- Learning happens during rest, not just study time
- Get 7-9 hours sleep for memory transfer to long-term storage
- Spaced repetition allows time for consolidation between reviews
- Vary study environments to strengthen memory cues
