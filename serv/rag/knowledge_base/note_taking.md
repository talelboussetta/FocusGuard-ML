# Note-Taking Systems

## Cornell Method

A structured note-taking system that divides the page into three sections for active review.

**Page Layout:**
```
+------------------+----------+
|  Cues/Questions  |   Notes  |
|    (Narrow)      |  (Wide)  |
|                  |          |
+------------------+----------+
|      Summary (Bottom)       |
+-----------------------------+
```

**How to Use:**
1. **During class:** Take notes in the main "Notes" section (right column)
2. **After class:** Write questions/cues in left column that prompt the notes
3. **Review:** Cover notes section, try to answer cue questions from memory
4. **Summarize:** Write 2-3 sentence summary at bottom of page

**Benefits:**
- Encourages active review (not passive rereading)
- Built-in self-testing with cue questions
- Summarization reinforces understanding
- Organized structure makes studying easier

**Best For:**
- Lecture-heavy courses
- Students who prefer linear note-taking
- Exam preparation (cues = practice questions)

## Zettelkasten (Slip Box)

A knowledge management system based on atomic, linked notes. Popularized by sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

**Core Principles:**
- **One idea per note** - Each note contains a single concept or insight
- **Link ideas explicitly** - Connect related notes with references
- **Write in your own words** - Don't copy-paste, rephrase for understanding
- **Make notes discoverable** - Use tags, indexes, or search-friendly keywords

**Workflow:**
1. **Fleeting notes** - Quick captures during reading/lectures
2. **Literature notes** - Summarize sources in your own words
3. **Permanent notes** - Atomic insights linked to existing knowledge
4. **Index notes** - Entry points to explore topic clusters

**Benefits:**
- Better deep understanding (requires processing, not copying)
- Easy retrieval (notes are linked, not buried in folders)
- Encourages connections between ideas (interdisciplinary thinking)
- Grows more valuable over time (compound knowledge)

**Tools:**
- **Obsidian** - Markdown-based, local files, graph view
- **Roam Research** - Block-based, bidirectional linking
- **Zettlr** - Open-source, academic focus
- **Physical cards** - Original analog system

**Best For:**
- Long-term knowledge building
- Research and writing projects
- Connecting ideas across subjects

## Mind Mapping

Visual diagrams that connect ideas radially around a central concept.

**How to Create:**
1. **Start with main idea** - Write central topic in the middle
2. **Branch out with subtopics** - Draw lines to major themes
3. **Add details** - Branch further with specifics, examples, facts
4. **Use colors, images, symbols** - Engage visual memory

**Benefits:**
- Visual organization (easier to remember than text)
- Stimulates creativity (non-linear thinking)
- Easy overview of relationships between concepts
- Engages spatial memory

**Best For:**
- Brainstorming and planning (essays, projects)
- Reviewing complex topics with many interconnections
- Visual learners
- Memorizing hierarchical information

**Tools:**
- **MindMeister** - Collaborative, cloud-based
- **XMind** - Feature-rich, offline option
- **Paper + colored pens** - Freeform, creative

## Outlining

Hierarchical structure of main topics and nested subpoints.

**Basic Structure:**
```
I. Main Topic
   A. Subtopic
      1. Detail
      2. Detail
   B. Subtopic
II. Main Topic
```

**How to Create:**
1. **Identify main topics** - Major themes or sections
2. **Add subpoints under each** - Supporting details, examples
3. **Use consistent formatting** - Indentation shows hierarchy

**Benefits:**
- Clear, logical structure
- Easy to follow progression
- Works well for linear material (history, procedures)
- Simple to create and modify

**Best For:**
- Lectures with clear structure
- Textbook reading notes
- Essay planning
- Legal, technical, or procedural subjects

**Tools:**
- Microsoft Word (built-in outline view)
- Google Docs
- Notion (toggle lists)
- WorkFlowy (infinite nesting)

## Annotation (Active Reading)

Engaging with text by highlighting, underlining, and adding margin notes.

**Best Practices:**
- **Highlight key points** - Main ideas, definitions, important data (use sparingly!)
- **Write margin notes** - Questions, connections, reactions, summaries
- **Summarize sections** - 1-2 sentences at end of each section
- **Use symbols** - ★ (important), ? (confused), ! (surprising), → (connection)
- **Review annotations** - Don't just highlight and forget

**Benefits:**
- Improved comprehension (active vs passive reading)
- Better retention (processing information)
- Creates personalized study guide
- Easy to review key points later

**Tools:**
- **Physical books** - Pencil, highlighters, sticky notes
- **PDFs** - Adobe Acrobat, PDF Expert, Foxit
- **Web articles** - Hypothesis, Liner, browser extensions
- **E-books** - Kindle highlights, Apple Books notes

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-highlighting (defeats the purpose - aim for <20% of text)
- Highlighting without understanding (read first, then highlight)
- Never reviewing annotations (schedule review sessions)

**Best For:**
- Reading-heavy courses (humanities, social sciences)
- Textbook study
- Research papers and articles
