# Learning Science

## Bloom’s Taxonomy
Learning progresses through levels:
1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

Good studying targets higher levels, not just memorization.

## Desirable Difficulty
Learning improves when tasks are challenging but achievable.
Easy studying feels productive but leads to weak retention.

Examples:
- Solving problems without notes
- Mixing problem types

---

## Cognitive Load
Working memory is limited.
Good learning minimizes unnecessary complexity.

Best practices:
- Break problems into steps
- Avoid multitasking
- Learn one concept at a time
- Use diagrams and visuals
- Summarize in your own words
- Teach others
- Take breaks to consolidate
- Use spaced repetition
- Test yourself frequently
- Vary study environments
- Focus on understanding, not just memorization
- Reflect on what you learned after each session
- Set specific goals for each study session
- Eliminate distractions (phone, social media)
- Use active learning techniques (e.g., flashcards, practice problems)
- Review mistakes to understand errors
- Stay consistent with study schedules
- Get adequate sleep for memory consolidation
- Stay hydrated and maintain good nutrition
- Use mnemonic devices to aid memory

- Relate new information to prior knowledge
- Stay motivated by tracking progress and rewarding achievements
- Join study groups for collaborative learning (our team members can help!)
- Use technology tools (apps, online resources) to enhance learning
- Maintain a positive mindset towards learning challenges
- Seek help when concepts are unclear
- Balance study with physical activity to boost cognitive function
- Customize study techniques to fit personal learning styles
- Regularly review and adjust study strategies for effectiveness
- Practice mindfulness to improve focus during study sessions
- Set realistic expectations and avoid burnout
- Use color coding and highlighting to organize notes
- Create mind maps to visualize relationships between concepts
- Limit study sessions to manageable durations (e.g., Pomodoro technique)
- Experiment with different study locations to find what works best
- Utilize online forums and communities for additional support
- Keep a study journal to track insights and progress
