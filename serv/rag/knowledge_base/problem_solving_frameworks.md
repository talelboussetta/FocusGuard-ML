# Problem Solving Frameworks

## General Problem Solving Process

A systematic approach applicable to any problem:

1. **Understand the problem** - What exactly is being asked? What's the goal?
2. **Define inputs and outputs** - What information do you have? What do you need to produce?
3. **Identify constraints** - Time limits, resources, requirements, limitations
4. **Solve stepwise** - Break down into manageable sub-steps
5. **Test edge cases** - Verify solution works for unusual inputs
6. **Review and refine** - Can it be improved or simplified?

**Best For:** Any unfamiliar problem, exams, coding challenges

## Divide and Conquer

Break complex problems into smaller, independent subproblems.

**Steps:**
1. **Decompose problem** - Split into smaller, manageable pieces
2. **Solve subproblems** - Work on each independently
3. **Combine solutions** - Integrate results into complete answer

**Example (Essay Writing):**
1. Decompose: Introduction + Body Paragraph 1 + Body Paragraph 2 + Conclusion
2. Solve each section independently
3. Combine into cohesive essay

**Best For:**
- Large projects (research papers, coding projects)
- Algorithm design (merge sort, binary search)
- Multi-part homework

---

## Working Backwards

Start from desired outcome and reverse-engineer the steps.

**Steps:**
1. **Define goal state** - What does success look like?
2. **Identify preceding steps** - What must happen immediately before?
3. **Reverse engineer to current state** - Continue until you reach where you are now

**Example (Exam Preparation):**
1. Goal: Score 90% on exam (Friday)
2. Preceding step: Complete practice exam successfully (Thursday)
3. Before that: Review all chapters (Mon-Wed)
4. Before that: Organize notes and identify weak areas (Sunday)
5. Start now: Gather all materials (Today)

**Best For:**
- Planning with deadlines
- Puzzle solving (mazes, logic puzzles)
- Goal achievement (work backward from target)

---

## Trial and Error

Iteratively test solutions and refine based on feedback.

**Steps:**
1. **Propose solution** - Make educated guess
2. **Test and evaluate** - Try it out, observe results
3. **Refine based on feedback** - Adjust and try again

**When to Use:**
- Experimental problems without clear formula
- Learning new tools or software
- Creative tasks (writing, design)
- When systematic analysis is impractical

**Caution:** Can be inefficient - use educated guesses, not random attempts

---

## Hypothesis Testing (Scientific Method)

Formulate testable hypotheses and systematically evaluate them.

**Steps:**
1. **State hypothesis** - "I believe X causes Y"
2. **Design experiments** - How can I test this?
3. **Collect data** - Run the test
4. **Analyze results** - Does data support or refute hypothesis?
5. **Refine or accept** - Adjust hypothesis or draw conclusions

**Example (Study Strategy):**
1. Hypothesis: "Studying with music improves my retention"
2. Experiment: Study half of material with music, half without
3. Test both sets equally
4. Analyze: Which set did I perform better on?
5. Conclusion: Adjust strategy based on results

**Best For:**
- Science experiments
- Debugging ("I think the error is in function X")
- Optimizing personal productivity

## Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

Identify underlying causes of problems by asking "Why?" repeatedly.

**Steps:**
1. **State the problem** - What went wrong?
2. **Ask "Why?" and answer** - What caused this?
3. **Repeat 5 times** (or until root cause identified)

**Example:**
- Problem: Failed the math test
- Why? Didn't understand derivatives
- Why? Didn't practice enough problems
- Why? Ran out of time to study
- Why? Procrastinated until the night before
- Why? Felt overwhelmed and avoided starting
- **Root cause:** Need strategies to break down large tasks and overcome procrastination

**Best For:**
- Troubleshooting recurring issues
- Performance analysis
- Identifying systemic problems

## SWOT Analysis

Evaluate **S**trengths, **W**eaknesses, **O**pportunities, **T**hreats.

**Framework:**
```
Internal Factors:
- Strengths: What are you good at?
- Weaknesses: What needs improvement?

External Factors:
- Opportunities: What favorable conditions exist?
- Threats: What obstacles might arise?
```

**Application (Choosing Courses):**
- Strengths: Strong in math, good time management
- Weaknesses: Weak writing skills, limited programming experience
- Opportunities: Data science field growing, online courses available
- Threats: Competitive admissions, heavy workload this semester

**Best For:**
- Strategic decision making
- Career planning
- Project planning

## PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

Continuous improvement loop for iterative problem solving.

**Steps:**
1. **Plan** - Identify problem and plan solution
2. **Do** - Implement solution on small scale (pilot test)
3. **Check** - Evaluate results (did it work?)
4. **Act** - If successful, standardize; if not, adjust and repeat

**Example (Improving Study Routine):**
1. Plan: Try Pomodoro Technique for one week
2. Do: Use 25-minute work blocks with 5-minute breaks
3. Check: Track productivity and focus levels
4. Act: Keep using if effective, or adjust interval lengths if needed

**Best For:**
- Process improvement
- Habit formation
- Quality control
- Iterative refinement

## Analogical Reasoning

Use similar known problems to inform solutions.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify analogous problem** - What similar situation have I seen?
2. **Map similarities** - What parallels exist?
3. **Adapt solution** - How can that approach apply here?

**Example:**
- New problem: Learning organic chemistry reactions
- Analogous: Previously learned language vocabulary
- Mapping: Both require memorization + pattern recognition
- Adapted solution: Use flashcards + spaced repetition (worked for language)

**Best For:**
- Creative problem solving
- Applying knowledge across domains
- When facing unfamiliar challenges
